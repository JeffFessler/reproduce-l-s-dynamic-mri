Matlab code for reproducing the results in the paper:
"Efficient Dynamic Parallel MRI Reconstruction
for the Low-Rank Plus Sparse Model,"
IEEE Trans. on Computational Imaging,

To download:
`git clone https://github.com/JeffFessler/reproduce-l-s-dynamic-mri.git`

This code requires the Matlab version of
the Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox (MIRT)
from
[http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/code/index.html]

Please set up MIRT before running the examples.

The authors also thank Ricardo Otazo
for sharing the cardiac MRI data.

Before running the code you must populate the data/ directory
with four .mat files from
[http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/irt/reproduce/19/lin-19-edp/]

The data is stored separately to keep the git repo light.
